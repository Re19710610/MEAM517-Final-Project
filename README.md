<div align=left>We decided that we were interested in trajectory optimization, but also that it would be interesting to approach a slightly different problem than what weâ€™ve seen before. Therefore, we decided to look at trajectory optimization for a bicycle, investigating what kind of path planning and control we could use to stabilize the dynamics and follow a trajectory. Some interesting aspects of the project could be dealing with the gyroscopic effects from the wheels, keeping the bicycle upright, and the behavior of needing to initially turn in the opposite direction in which you want to go. <br>
    In general, we need to address the bicycle self-stability problem, the tracking problem, the running costs minimization problem, and so on. The self-stability problem is the most important problem to be focused on. It needs to construct the linear kinematic and dynamic models for the bicycle first. How to ameliorate an autonomous bicycle running stability in the low-speed range, during a turn, or on the slope could be significant to address. The effective braking balance and movement of the mass load center were able to considerably and significantly contribute to the stabilization of the vehicle from the previous research. For the trajectory problem, like avoiding the obstacle and minimizing the running cost, we have to design control policies for the motion of a bicycle robot, which is not that different from general trajectory optimization. This could be accomplished through designing a controller (iLQR, MPC, etc.) and implementing it in simulation to control a bicycle over terrain and around obstacles. Ideally we would end up with controllers we could evaluate and compare on a simulated bicycle, and get insight into optimal control strategies for a bicycle.<br>
